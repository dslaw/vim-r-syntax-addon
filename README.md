# Additional R syntax highlighting

`r.vim` contains function highlighting for R objects included in the builtin
packages: base, graphics, grDevices, methods, stats and utils. This is intended to
expand upon the default R syntax file included with Vim. To enable its use, place
the file in `~/.vim/after/syntax`.
